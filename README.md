# Assetto Corsa media key app
Media key (Play, Next, Prev) as an Assetto Corsa UI app.

Install instruction: \
1. Drop the `media_key` forlder in your `assettocorsa\apps\python` folder.
2. (Content Manager user only) Enable this app in content Manager (Setting -> Assetto Corsa -> Apps).

Shoutout to Logitech Gaming Software for being so broken that I needed to code this up myself.
